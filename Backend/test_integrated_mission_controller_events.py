"""
Manual test + simple assertions for IntegratedMissionController event emissions.

Run from Backend directory:

    python test_integrated_mission_controller_events.py

This script:
- Mocks a MAVROS bridge with minimal methods
- Instantiates IntegratedMissionController with a status callback that records events
- Loads a 2-waypoint mission
- Starts the mission (upload handled by mock bridge)
- Simulates reaching a waypoint and verifies emitted events:
  - waypoint_reached
  - waypoint_marked (completed)
- Simulates a waypoint timeout and verifies a failed waypoint_marked event

The script prints pass/fail and exits with non-zero status on failure.
